\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis covers the theoretical research and practical implementation of the HopeMesh project. The HopeMesh project has the goal to implement a fail-safe wireless mesh network prototype using embedded technologies. The hardware implementation uses a custom schematic and printed circuit board design using an ATmega 162 CPU and a HopeRF RFM12B radio module. The software implementation is composed of a protothread based implementation for the main loop and a 5-tier network stack. A theoretical concurrency model is proposed as well as a petri-net based radio module driver. The routing algorithm is based on the B.A.T.M.A.N. algorithm. Finally a PC based simulator is being developed and the performance of the final design evaluated.
